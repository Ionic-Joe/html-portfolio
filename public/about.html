<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there, my alias is Joe the Zambian Developer. I am a thirty something year old living in - you guessed it, Zambia right in the heart of africa.</p>

<p>II currently work in the ISP space but took up coding to explore its possibilities. </p>

<p>This is my first public website that I will be building on, hope you can follow me along the journey</p>
